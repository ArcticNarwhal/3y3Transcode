This Android app implements an algorithm to obfuscate text. Originally it was implemented by Twilight Sparkle (@yourcompanionAI) on its [website](https://synthetic.garden/3y3.htm).

The algorithm maps codepoints from U+0001 to U+007E to codepoints from U+E0001 to U+E007E in order obfuscate them. They appear as zero width characters and can be hidden between normal text.

The project is a reference to the game Hypnospace Outlaw.
